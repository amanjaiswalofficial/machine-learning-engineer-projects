# LLM Learning Roadmap  

## Foundation: Understanding the Basics  
- **Tokenization Basics**  
  - Write a program to tokenize text into words and subwords using tools like Hugging Face's Tokenizer library.  

- **Word Embeddings**  
  - Implement word embedding lookup using pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.  

- **Positional Encodings**  
  - Understand and implement positional encodings used in Transformers.  

- **Attention Mechanism**  
  - Code a simple self-attention mechanism from scratch to understand how it works.  

- **Transformer Encoder Block**  
  - Implement a single Transformer encoder block, including multi-head attention and feed-forward layers.  

- **Understanding Pre-trained Models**  
  - Load a small pre-trained model (e.g., DistilBERT) using Hugging Face and perform text classification.  

## Intermediate: Building a Model Pipeline  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**  
  - Write a preprocessing pipeline to clean and tokenize text for LLM training.  

- **Fine-Tuning Basics**  
  - Fine-tune a small pre-trained model on a classification task (e.g., sentiment analysis).  

- **Custom Dataset Creation**  
  - Create a custom dataset using text data (e.g., scraping news articles or loading CSV files).  

- **Transformer Decoder Block**  
  - Implement a Transformer decoder block to understand how it differs from the encoder.  

- **Training a Transformer from Scratch**  
  - Train a small Transformer model on a toy dataset (e.g., predicting the next word).  

- **Masked Language Modeling**  
  - Fine-tune a BERT model for masked language modeling.  

## Advanced: Diving Deeper  
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**  
  - Implement a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model for translation.  

- **Text Summarization**  
  - Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., BART or T5) for text summarization.  

- **Memory Management**  
  - Optimize training for large models using gradient accumulation and mixed precision.  

- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**  
  - Use LoRA to fine-tune a large model like LLaMA on a small dataset.  

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  - Experiment with few-shot, zero-shot, and instruction-based prompts on a large model.  

- **Training from Scratch**  
  - Train a medium-sized Transformer model from scratch on a real-world dataset (e.g., WikiText).  

## Expert: Scaling and Deployment  
- **Distributed Training**  
  - Use tools like DeepSpeed or PyTorch Lightning to train models across multiple GPUs.  

- **Model Quantization**  
  - Quantize a model to reduce its size and speed up inference.  

- **Model Distillation**  
  - Distill a large model into a smaller, faster model.  

- **Serving Models**  
  - Deploy a trained model as an API using tools like FastAPI or Flask.  

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  - Combine a language model with a retrieval system for better context handling.  

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - Implement metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity for NLP tasks.  

- **Fine-Tune Large Models with Custom Objectives**  
  - Fine-tune a large model on a custom objective (e.g., reinforcement learning with human feedback).
